                        <h5>How does Piqora help me Drive ROI on Pinterest?</h5>

                        <h5>How does Piqora help me get more followers on Instagram?</h5>
                        <p>The best way to grow your community on Instagram is to launch a photo contest.

                        <h5>Do Hashtags Matter on Pinterest?</h5>
                        <p>Not really. Since about 90% of your brand’s pins on Pinterest come from your website, they will naturally have your product description and keywords in the pin (if your site has been pin-optimized). </p>
                        <p>Discovery on Pinterest is based on following individual boards and search.</p>

                        <h5>Can I try the product?</h5>
                        <p>Of course, just request a demo and we’ll reach out to show you how Piqora works using some of your own data from Pinerest, Instagram, and Tumblr.</p>
