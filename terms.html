    <div class="legal-container">
        <p>Welcome to Piqora.com, the website and online service of Piqora, Inc.
        (“Piqora,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online
        and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection with the service
        (collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read,
        understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) and
        to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Piqora Privacy Policy
        www.piqora.com/privacy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This
        Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p>
            <h3>1. Use of Our Service</h3>
        <h4>A. Eligibility</h4>

        <p>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Piqora, and only in
        compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws,
        rules and regulations. Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited
        and in violation of this Agreement. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed
        from the Service by Piqora.</p>

        <h4>B. Piqora Service</h4>

        <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive,
        limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service as permitted by the
        features of the Service. Piqora reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the
        Service and the Piqora Content (as defined below). Piqora may terminate this license
        at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>

        <h4>C. Piqora Accounts</h4>

        <p>Your Piqora account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may
        establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different
        types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Piqora account on behalf of
        a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b)
        you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the
        authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the
        entity’s behalf. By connecting to Piqora with a third-party service, you give us permission
        to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store
        your log-in credentials for that service.</p>

        <p>You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account,
        you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the
        activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We
        encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and
        lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Piqora
        immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Piqora will not
        be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <p>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the
        settings in your account profile page. By providing Piqora your email address you consent
        to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices
        required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address
        to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If
        you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences
        in your account profile page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages
        regarding updates, improvements, or offers.</p>

        <h4>D. Service Rules</h4>

        <p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing,
        or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any
        automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without
        limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that
        sends more request messages to the Piqora servers than a human can reasonably produce
        in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser; (iii) transmitting
        spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise
        the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running
        the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an
        unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data,
        viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting
        any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using
        the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or
        otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding
        or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service;
        (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those
        provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or
        restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use
        or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.</p>

        <p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features
        of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may
        permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and
        liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this
        Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to
        be bound by this Agreement.</p>

        <p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Piqora Users. We reserve the
        right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Piqora
        shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.</p>

        <h3>2. User Content</h3>

        <p>Some areas of the Service allow Users to post content such as profile information, comments,
        questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays,
        or otherwise makes available on the Service “User Content”). You retain ownership of your
        User Content. Please note that Piqora does not store or copy to its servers any “perks”
        or “promotions” you create, nor does it store or copy any product/brand images you may link
        through “pinning” on Pinterest.</p>

        <p>You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental
        injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you,
        to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any
        person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate
        content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute
        to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful,
        harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal
        privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise),
        libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or
        content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under
        securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content
        that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary
        relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and
        current. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-
        party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined
        below) or rights of privacy. To the extent that your User Content contains music, you hereby
        represent that you are the owner of all the copyright rights, including without limitation the
        performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect to each and every musical
        composition (including lyrics) and sound recording contained in such User Content and have the
        power to grant the license granted below. Piqora reserves the right, but is not obligated,
        to reject and/or remove any User Content that Piqora believes, in its sole discretion,
        violates these provisions. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is
        not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America,
        or any other rights organization.</p>

        <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights,
        copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and
        service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may
        now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations,
        renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other
        jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:</p>

        <p>A. You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the
        User Content to use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service
        and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in
        relation to such use.</p>

        <p>B. Your User Content and Piqora’s use thereof as contemplated by this
        Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party,
        including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.</p>

        <p>C. Piqora may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this
        Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or
        royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.</p>

        <p>Piqora takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or
        any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service. You shall be solely responsible
        for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we
        are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User
        Content.</p>

        <h3>3. User Content License Grant</h3>

        <p>By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and
        warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Piqora a royalty-free, sublicensable,
        transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list
        information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display,
        and make derivative works of all such User Content on the Service solely to provide you with
        the features and functionality of the Service.</p>

        <p>You may link your company’s Facebook or Twitter account to Piqora in order to link
        relevant content suggested by Piqora to your Facebook and Twitter accounts. If you
        choose to link your Facebook or Twitter account with Piqora, you hereby grant Piqora
        permission to access and post to your Facebook or Twitter account.</p>

        <h3>4. Our Proprietary Rights</h3>
        <p>Except for your User Content, the Service and all materials therein or transferred thereby,
        including, without limitation, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents,
        trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and User Content
        belonging to other Users (the “Piqora Content”), and all Intellectual Property Rights
        related thereto, are the exclusive property of Piqora and its licensors (including other
        Users who post User Content to the Service). Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in
        this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property
        Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit,
        publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any
        Piqora Content. Use of the Piqora Content for any purpose not expressly permitted
        by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.</p>

        <p>You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service,
        including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Ideas”). By
        submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without
        restriction and will not place Piqora under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we
        are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the
        Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by
        acceptance of your submission, Piqora does not waive any rights to use similar or related
        ideas previously known to Piqora, or developed by its employees, or obtained from
        sources other than you.</p>

        <h3>5. Paid Services</h3>

        <h4>A. Paid Services</h4>
        <p><i>Fees:</i> If you elect to create or upgrade to a premium account plan on the Service, you agree
        to the pricing terms, as we may update them from time to time.
        We may add new services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for
        existing services, at any time in our sole discretion. You may terminate your paid account plan
        as set forth below in “Cancellation At Any Time With No Refund.”</p>

        <p><i>Billing Terms:</i> We bill all paid accounts in advance at the beginning of each month (usually on
        the 1st or 2nd day of the month) for use of the Service during the upcoming month. New paid
        accounts opened mid-month will be billed on a pro-rated basis for the duration of that month.
        If you upgrade or downgrade between plans mid-month, you will be charged a pro-rated fee
        for the difference in subscription fees between the two plans for the duration of that month,
        and will be billed in full at the new subscription rate at the beginning of the next month. You
        may terminate your paid account plan as set forth below
        in “Cancellation At Any Time With No Refund.”</p>

        <p><i>Payment Obligations:</i> All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or
        financial transaction on or through the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You
        agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment
        method used in connection with a purchase or financial transaction on or through the Service
        at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any,
        relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions.</p>

        <h4>B. Subscription &amp; Renewals</h4>
        <p><i>Automatic Renewals:</i> In order to provide continuous service, we automatically renew all paid
        subscriptions for the Services on the date such subscriptions expire. Such renewals are for the
        same duration as the original subscription term (for example, a 1-month subscription will renew
        on a monthly basis). By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your account will
        be subject to the above-described automatic renewals. In all cases, if you do not wish your
        account to renew automatically, please follow the directions set out under "Cancellation At Any
        Time With No Refund" below.</p>

        <h4>C. Cancellation At Any Time With No Refund</h4>

        <p><i>Overview:</i> Except as otherwise stated in this section, you may cancel your paid subscription at
        any time during the term of such subscription or any renewal period by cancelling the account.</p>

        <p><i>Cancelling Your Account:</i> To cancel a premium account, the account administrator (the person
        who created the account) should contact us by sending an email to support@piqora.com
        and include the account’s login credentials and a request to close the account. In such case,
        your subscription will terminate at the end of the month for which you have paid, and you will
        not receive any refund for any unused days of such subscription term. It is your obligation
        to extract any data collected prior to the termination of your account. Piqora will not
        back-up or otherwise retain data or information associated with your account following any
        termination or expiration of your account. If you have any questions about cancelling your
        account, please contact us at support@piqora.com.</p>

        <h3>6. Privacy</h3>

        <p>We care about the privacy of our Users. You understand that by using the Services you
        consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information and
        aggregate data as set forth in our Privacy Policy www.piqora.com/privacy, and to have
        your personally identifiable information collected, used, transferred to and processed in the
        United States.</p>

        <h3>7. Security</h3>

        <p>Piqora cares about the integrity and security of your personal information. However,

        provide your personal information at your own risk.</p>

        <h3>8. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or
        controlled by Piqora, including Pinterest’s online service. Piqora does not endorse or
        assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, and is not responsible for any delays,
        outages, interruptions, or failures caused by or resulting from such third party services. If you
        access a third party website like Pinterest from the Service, you do so at your own risk, and you
        understand that this Agreement and Piqora’s Privacy Policy do not apply to your use of
        such sites. You expressly relieve Piqora from any and all liability arising from your use of
        any third-party website, service, or content.</p>

        <h3>9. Indemnity</h3>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Piqora and its subsidiaries, agents,
        licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents,
        officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
        liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from:
        (i) your use of and access to the Service, including any data or content transmitted or received
        by you; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement, including without limitation your

        access and use of the Service with your unique username, password or other appropriate
        security code.</p>

        WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM PIQORA OR THROUGH THE
        SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING

        BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
        EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
        GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF,

        LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT;
        (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING

        <p>THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON
        CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF PIQORA
        HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION
        OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE
        JURISDICTION.</p>

        <p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION
        OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS
        OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS AGREEMENT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL
        RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. THE
        DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL
        NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

        <p>The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States. Piqora
        makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations.
        Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and
        are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and
        regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the
        Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign
        person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise

        <h3>12. Governing Law and Arbitration</h3>

        <p><strong>A. Governing Law.</strong> You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in
        California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal
        jurisdiction over Piqora, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.
        This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California,
        without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations
        Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to
        submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Mateo County,
        Californa for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable
        relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
        misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other
        intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.</p>

        <p><strong>B. Arbitration.</strong> For any dispute with Piqora, you agree to first
        contact us at [email] and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely
        event that Piqora has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to
        do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any
        Piqora claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or
        relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by
        binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial
        Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect
        for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in San Mateo County,
        California, unless you and Piqora agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying
        any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award
        rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and
        reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by
        the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section
        shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as
        necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of
        that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. ALL CLAIMS
        MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
        MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE
        AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S
        CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND PIQORA ARE
        EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

        <h3>13. General</h3>

        <p><strong>A. Assignment.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder,
        may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Piqora without
        restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>

        <p><strong>B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.</strong> Piqora may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for
        marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy
        notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Piqora in our
        sole discretion. Piqora reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing
        notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as
        described in this Agreement. Piqora is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or
        your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you
        provide us. Piqora may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time
        to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a
        material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page. Your
        continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new
        Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use
        or access (or continue to access) the Service.</p>

        <p><strong>C. Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong> This Agreement, together with any
        amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Piqora in connection
        with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Piqora concerning
        the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent
        jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
        provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <p><strong>D. No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further
        or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Piqora’s failure to assert any
        right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

        <p><strong>E. Contact.</strong> Please contact us support@piqora.com with any questions
        regarding this Agreement.</p>

        <p><strong>F. Image Cache Expiration.</strong> Piqora caches images i.e pins from Pinterest and 
        tagged photos from Instagram for a period of 120 days after initial access. Image caching allows 
        Piqora to render faster reports in our dashboard. These images are deleted from our servers and 
        local caches after 120 days.</p>
