<h2>PIQORA, INC.<br/>Terms of Use Agreement</h2>
<p>Welcome to Piqora.com, the website and online service of Piqora, Inc.
(“Piqora,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online
and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection with the service
(collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read,
understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) and
to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Piqora Privacy Policy
www.piqora.com/privacy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This
Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH
PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES
PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE
DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.</p>
<h3>1. Use of Our Service</h3>
<h4>A. Eligibility</h4>
<p>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Piqora, and only in
compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws,
rules and regulations. Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited
and in violation of this Agreement. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed
from the Service by Piqora.</p>
<h4>B. Piqora Service</h4>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive,
limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service as permitted by the
features of the Service. Piqora reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the
Service and the Piqora Content (as defined below). Piqora may terminate this license
at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>
<h4>C. Piqora Accounts</h4>
<p>Your Piqora account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may
establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different
types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Piqora account on behalf of
a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b)
you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the
entity’s behalf. By connecting to Piqora with a third-party service, you give us permission
to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store
your log-in credentials for that service.</p>
<p>You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account,
you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the
activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We
encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and
lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Piqora
immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Piqora will not
be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the
settings in your account profile page. By providing Piqora your email address you consent
to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices
required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address
to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If
you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences
in your account profile page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages
regarding updates, improvements, or offers.</p>
<h4>D. Service Rules</h4>
<p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing,
or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any
automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without
limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that
sends more request messages to the Piqora servers than a human can reasonably produce
in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser; (iii) transmitting
spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise
the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running
the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an
unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data,
viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting
any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using
the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or
otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding
or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service;
(xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those
provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or
restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use
or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.</p>
<p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features
of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may
permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and
liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this
Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to
be bound by this Agreement.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Piqora Users. We reserve the
right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users. Piqora
shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.</p>
<h3>2. User Content</h3>
<p>Some areas of the Service allow Users to post content such as profile information, comments,
questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays,
or otherwise makes available on the Service “User Content”). You retain ownership of your
User Content. Please note that Piqora does not store or copy to its servers any “perks”
or “promotions” you create, nor does it store or copy any product/brand images you may link
through “pinning” on Pinterest.</p>
<p>You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental

content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under

that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary
relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and
current. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-
party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined
below) or rights of privacy. To the extent that your User Content contains music, you hereby
represent that you are the owner of all the copyright rights, including without limitation the
performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect to each and every musical
composition (including lyrics) and sound recording contained in such User Content and have the
power to grant the license granted below. Piqora reserves the right, but is not obligated,
to reject and/or remove any User Content that Piqora believes, in its sole discretion,
violates these provisions. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is
not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America,
or any other rights organization.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights,
copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and
service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may
now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations,
renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:</p>
<p>A. You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the
User Content to use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service
and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in
relation to such use.</p>
<p>B. Your User Content and Piqora’s use thereof as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party,
including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.</p>
<p>C. Piqora may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this
Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or
royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.</p>
<p>Piqora takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or
any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service. You shall be solely responsible
for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we
are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User
Content.</p>
<h3>3. User Content License Grant</h3>
<p>By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and
warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Piqora a royalty-free, sublicensable,
transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list

belonging to other Users (the “Piqora Content”), and all Intellectual Property Rights
related thereto, are the exclusive property of Piqora and its licensors (including other
Users who post User Content to the Service). Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property
Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit,
publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any
Piqora Content. Use of the Piqora Content for any purpose not expressly permitted

<p>You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service,
including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Ideas”). By
submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without
restriction and will not place Piqora under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we

Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by
acceptance of your submission, Piqora does not waive any rights to use similar or related

existing services, at any time in our sole discretion. You may terminate your paid account plan
as set forth below in “Cancellation At Any Time With No Refund.”</p>
<p><i>Free Trial Account:</i> Users may try Piqora for free by signing up for a free trial account
for 21 days. No payment information is required upon signing up for a trial account. At the
expiration of the 21-day trial period, the User’s account will be deactivated, and the User will
be required to upgrade to a paid account in order to continue using the Service.</p>
<p><i>Billing Terms:</i> We bill all paid accounts in advance at the beginning of each month (usually on
the 1st or 2nd day of the month) for use of the Service during the upcoming month. New paid
accounts opened mid-month will be billed on a pro-rated basis for the duration of that month.
If you upgrade or downgrade between plans mid-month, you will be charged a pro-rated fee
for the difference in subscription fees between the two plans for the duration of that month,
and will be billed in full at the new subscription rate at the beginning of the next month. You
may terminate your paid account plan as set forth below
in “Cancellation At Any Time With No Refund.”</p>

financial transaction on or through the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You

at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any,
relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions.</p>
<h4>B. Subscription & Renewals</h4>
<p><i>Automatic Renewals:</i> In order to provide continuous service, we automatically renew all paid
subscriptions for the Services on the date such subscriptions expire. Such renewals are for the
same duration as the original subscription term (for example, a 1-month subscription will renew
on a monthly basis). By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your account will
be subject to the above-described automatic renewals. In all cases, if you do not wish your
account to renew automatically, please follow the directions set out under "Cancellation At Any
Time With No Refund" below.</p>
<h4>C. Cancellation At Any Time With No Refund</h4>
<p><i>Overview:</i> Except as otherwise stated in this section, you may cancel your paid subscription at
any time during the term of such subscription or any renewal period by cancelling the account.</p>
<p><i>Cancelling Your Account:</i> To cancel a premium account, the account administrator (the person
who created the account) should contact us by sending an email to support@piqora.com
and include the account’s login credentials and a request to close the account. In such case,
your subscription will terminate at the end of the month for which you have paid, and you will
not receive any refund for any unused days of such subscription term. It is your obligation
to extract any data collected prior to the termination of your account. Piqora will not
back-up or otherwise retain data or information associated with your account following any
termination or expiration of your account. If you have any questions about cancelling your
account, please contact us at support@piqora.com.</p>

makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations.
Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and
are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and
regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the
Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign
person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise
explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies,
or other entities located in the United States.</p>
<h3>12. Governing Law and Arbitration</h3>
<p><strong>A. Governing Law.</strong> You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in
California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal
jurisdiction over Piqora, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.
This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California,
without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to
submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Mateo County,
Californa for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable
relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other
intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.</p>
<p><strong>B. Arbitration.</strong> For any dispute with Piqora, you agree to first
contact us at [email] and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely
event that Piqora has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to
do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any
Piqora claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or
relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by
binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial
Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect
for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in San Mateo County,
California, unless you and Piqora agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying
any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award
rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and
reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section
shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as
necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of
that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. ALL CLAIMS
MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE
AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S
CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND PIQORA ARE
EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<h3>13. General</h3>
<p><strong>A. Assignment.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder,
may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Piqora without
restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
<p><strong>B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.</strong> Piqora may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for
marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy
notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Piqora in our
sole discretion. Piqora reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing
notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as
described in this Agreement. Piqora is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or
your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you
provide us. Piqora may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time
to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a
material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page. Your
continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new
Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use
or access (or continue to access) the Service.</p>
<p><strong>C. Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong> This Agreement, together with any
amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Piqora in connection
with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Piqora concerning
the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><strong>D. No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further
or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Piqora’s failure to assert any
right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p><strong>E. Contact.</strong> Please contact us support@piqora.com with any questions
regarding this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>F. Image Cache Expiration.</strong> Piqora caches images i.e pins from Pinterest and
tagged photos from Instagram for a period of 120 days after initial access. Image caching allows
Piqora to render faster reports in our dashboard. These images are deleted from our servers and
local caches after 120 days.</p>
